# College Search ETL Pipeline

## Revolutionizing College Search with AI-Powered Assistance

This project focuses on developing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data from [Edusanjal](https://edusanjal.com/), a college aggregator website. The goal is to create a comprehensive dataset that enables innovative solutions to provide personalized college recommendations.

## Background

Selecting the right college is often overwhelming for students due to the vast amount of information they need to considerâ€”ranging from course offerings and faculty expertise to campus amenities and financial aid options. While AI has the potential to simplify this decision-making process through personalized recommendations, it requires access to detailed and comprehensive data about educational institutions.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Extraction**: Scrape detailed profiles of colleges and universities, including information on courses, faculty, admission processes, and more.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean and structure the scraped data to make it suitable for storage.
- **Data Loading**: Store the processed data in a format that can be easily accessed.
