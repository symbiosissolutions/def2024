It should be used with students who are writing simple sentences as it reinforces spacing between words.', 'When students have their spacing down, the S in CUPS then takes on a different meaning. S now stands for spelling. Below is a video clip that demonstrates the four parts of CUPS using S for spelling. (Note- the video does not say that it is using the CUPS technique so the classroom teacher will need to interject and point out each skill)', 'Sight Word Practice: Below are a few of the many YouTube videos that are likely to capture the attention of those currently trying to master sight words and high frequency words.', 'Punctuation practice: Here are several several supplemental videos that can be used to explain and demonstrate types of punctuation used at the end of a sentence.', 'Capitalization practice: Below are several supplemental videos that clarify and demonstrate capitalization rules.', 'COPS...Students who have progressed into the various types of writing may still use CUPS, but COPS is another\\xa0 acronym to help in the writing and editing process. The U in CUPS now becomes an O to make COPS. The O stands for organization as seen in the video below.', 'COPS use MAPS: MAPS is yet another acronym and strategy to use after a student has written a rough draft.', 'Last but not least...Here are some final tips to think of and use before publishing.']\n",
