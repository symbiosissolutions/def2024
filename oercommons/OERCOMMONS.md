# Personalized English Learning ETL Pipeline

## Creating a Dataset for AI-Powered Elementary English Education

This project focuses on developing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape educational content from [OER Commons](https://oercommons.org/), an open educational resources aggregator. The goal is to compile a comprehensive dataset that powers innovative AI solutions to deliver personalized English language learning experiences tailored to the needs of elementary students.

### Background

Personalized learning is key to improving educational outcomes, yet many elementary-level English language learners lack access to tailored educational experiences. Traditional teaching methods often fail to address the diverse needs of individual students, limiting their progress. With the rise of AI-powered educational tools, there's significant potential to provide customized language learning experiences. These innovations require rich, varied datasets to function effectively.

### Project Objectives

- **Data Extraction**: Scrape educational content suitable for elementary-level English learners, including lesson plans, textbooks, videos and assessments.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean and structure the scraped data to make it suitable for storage.
- **Data Loading**: Store the processed data in a format that can be easily accessed.
